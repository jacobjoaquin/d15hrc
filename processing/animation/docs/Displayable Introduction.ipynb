    "# Displayable Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Displayable! An animation toolkit for all your sequencing and live performance means.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a living document that will be updated regularly. So check back often.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Displayable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Displayable is animation toolkit / library for Processing for creating, sequencing, and modulating animations based on [MUSIC-N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC-N) principles. It's animation software built like a computer music language, though builds on fundamental Java principles, and is highly extensible thanks to Java's OOP nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this was developed with the intent of creating animations for LED art, the design of Displayable allows it to be used as a general purpose animation library. While we're using it for sequencing for the burn, it does support realtime interaction as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Displayable is known as \"moonpaper\" in the repo but this will change after the burn, because tis a silly name, and Displayable better represents its roots. In fact, most everything in the classes / methods will be renamed post-burn.  Don't worry, I'll update all the animation code written for the burn so it doesn't suffer from data loss."

    "\n",
    "This is a single PDE file that contains all the supporting classes and methods required for your animations, sequences, simulators, etc.  The master version can be found [here](https://github.com/jacobjoaquin/d15hrc/tree/master/processing/3d/displayabletoolkit).\n",

    "### Building a Virtual LED Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A virutal LED structure is created by specifying the two endpoints of a strip, and setting the density. See the [createTeatro](https://github.com/jacobjoaquin/d15hrc/tree/master/processing/3d/createTeatro) sketch for details.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Each strip is a row in the pg.\n",
    "- Each row in the pg will not be used, since strips will vary in length and density.\n",

    "### JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is used be the animations, sequences, and simulators. The JSON file stores each an ordered list of strips, and the order matters. This should be handled automagically on the back end. Each strip object in the JSON becomes a row the the `PixelMap.pg` in the order they are read. \n",
